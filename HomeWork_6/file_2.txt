Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
 regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
 but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
 popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications,
 with a reported 9 million developers.
